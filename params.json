  "body": "#QuickNotify\r\n\r\nQuickNotify is a quick way to create Mac OS X notifications. It was created to be easy and streamlined.\r\n##Usage\r\n\r\nTo create a new notification, simply click on the menu bar icon with the QuickNotify icon (like this: ![Menubar Icon][2]). You will be greeted with a dialog that has the categories Title, Subtitle, Message, Seconds, Minutes, and Hours. Title is the large title at the top of the notification, Subtitle is directly beneath it, and, finally, Message is the smallest and lowest text area.\r\nSeconds, Minutes, and Hours denote the delay until the notification appears. To send it to the notification centre, just click send, or click cancel if you decide that you don't want to send it after all.\r\n[2]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kman14367/QuickNotify/master/src/packaged/iconbw.png\r\n##License\r\n\r\n```\r\nThis is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain.\r\n\r\nAnyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or\r\ndistribute this software, either in source code form or as a compiled\r\nbinary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\nIn jurisdictions that recognize copyright laws, the author or authors\r\nof this software dedicate any and all copyright interest in the\r\nsoftware to the public domain.
